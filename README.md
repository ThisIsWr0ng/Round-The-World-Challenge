Creating an application for Blue Cow company required an understanding the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). The Blue Cow needs software to calculate the shortest round route for 30 – 50 cities around the world for its aeroplane race. This closely resembles a TSP as it focuses on finding an optimised round trip across given locations. TSP is categorised as an NP-Hard problem and was formulated in the 1800s by the Irish mathematician W.R. Hamilton and by the British mathematician Thomas Kirkman. Blue Cow’s software must be able to select only the most profitable route from the pool of around 100 cities, which makes it more complicated than classic TSP.
For the implementation of the software, C# programming language and Windows Forms were chosen for the Graphical User Interface (GUI). Creating a user interface was quick and easy, thanks to drag and drop functionality of the Windows Forms class library.
